                  <a href="/en/article/democracy-is-not-a-value/"><h2>Democracy is not a value</h2></a>
                  <p><p><strong>1. Democracy is not a value.</strong><br>
It is not an ideal, not a virtue, not a moral compass. It is a cold mechanism for counting heads - nothing more. To worship it as something higher is delusion.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>2. Democracy does not guarantee prosperity.</strong><br>
History is full of "democratic" ruins, bankrupt states, and societies rotting in apathy. Votes do not build wealth. Ballots do not feed the hungry. Procedures do not save lives.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>3. Democracy is legalized violence.</strong><br>
Every state rules by force. Democracy only baptizes this force with the will of the majority. Violence branded as "lawful" is still violence - brutal, merciless, and often blind.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>4. Democracy is the tyranny of the majority.</strong><br>
The mob decides, and its will becomes absolute. Minorities can be crushed, erased, annihilated - and the system still calls itself "just." In truth, it is nothing but sanctioned oppression.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>5. Democracy is not compassion.</strong><br>
Rights and dignity are trampled the moment they stand in the way of numbers. Without institutions and values stronger than votes, democracy degenerates into cruelty, where the weak exist only at the mercy of the crowd.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>6. Democracy expands oppression endlessly.</strong><br>
Imagine a fire lit by the crowd. At first, only branches burn - the "obvious enemies." Then books and thoughts are thrown in, because silence must be kept. Soon, people themselves are fed to the flames - strangers, then dissenters, then those who simply stood apart. Each step feels justified, each expansion inevitable. The majority always demands a new victim, until nothing remains but fire itself.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong><br>
Democracy is not sacred. It is not justice, not freedom, not safety. It can liberate or massacre, uplift or devour. The true measure of society lies not in ballots, but in its humanity - in its will to protect every person, even against the frenzy of the majority.</p>

                  <a href="/en/article/freedom-of-speech-must-be-mutually-respected/"><h2>Freedom of speech must be mutually respected</h2></a>
                  <p>As a refugee from Russia, I call on the so-called western governments, the European Union, Canada, and other democratic societies to address an alarming reality: pro-Russian media funded by oligarchs and the state continue to operate freely within Europe and America, spreading propaganda and misinformation. Meanwhile, any journalist attempting to speak freely in Russia faces imprisonment, torture, or even death. Allowing such channels a voice here, while their government silences dissent at home, is a betrayal of the values that define free societies.
<br><br>
Freedom of speech must work both ways. When the Russian government blatantly disregards public agreements, such as upholding human rights, we must reassess the freedoms we extend to its advocates within our borders. Granting pro-Russian media the liberties their own country denies its citizens undermines our principles and security alike.
<br><br>
As societies built on the values of free speech, free thought, and open information, we must ensure these freedoms are mutually respected. We limit the rights of individuals who cross ethical and legal boundaries; this is why we have a justice system. Yet, we hesitate to place the same restrictions on a terrorist state that disregards fundamental human rights, undermines our societal stability, and, through its intelligence services, commits violent acts even within free nations. From the tragic Skripal incident to countless other examples, the threat is clear.
<br><br>
For those of us who have fled persecution, it is devastating to witness the West’s tolerance of forces that trample on basic freedoms. It feels like witnessing a re-legitimization of historical atrocities in front of the very people who have suffered from them. Just as rehumanizing the Holocaust would be an affront to Jewish communities worldwide, tolerating pro-Russian propaganda in free societies is an affront to those of us who have endured state-sanctioned oppression.
<br><br>
Russia’s flirtation with far-right movements in Europe and America is as hypocritical as it is alarming. While the Kremlin claims to be on a crusade against so-called "Nazis" in Ukraine, it eagerly courts neo-fascist and ultranationalist allies abroad. This twisted alignment underscores a disturbing truth: Russian political ideology today is a breeding ground for xenophobic and racist policies, often aligning directly with the core tenets of these far-right groups.
<br><br>
In Europe and the U.S., these far-right factions, championing anti-immigrant (for real of racism) and anti-LGBT agendas, echo sentiments regularly voiced by Russian leaders. It is no secret that Russia’s domestic policies are notoriously repressive, especially towards LGBTQ+ individuals and some religious minority communities. Racism under the guise of so-called "protecting the jobs" and xenophobia under the guise of protecting the so-called “traditional values and family” are normalized and even carved in stone by law. Far-right groups in the West look to Russia as a model for how to “reclaim” their countries from so-called "liberal rot". This dangerous synergy goes beyond words; it actively erodes democratic values and fuels authoritarianism on both sides.
<br><br>
The similarities between far-right agendas in the West and Russian nationalism are staggering. Russia and western far-right leaders share a chilling vision of society: one devoid of diversity, steeped in intolerance, and controlled by authoritarian rule. By aligning with the Kremlin, Western far-right movements effectively endorse Russia’s oppressive policies, lending credibility to a regime that routinely silences dissent and enforces rigid social conformity.
<br><br>
This growing admiration for repressive values threatens to drag the Western world back to a time when totalitarianism ruled and freedom was a foreign concept. The values of tolerance, diversity, and human rights - the cornerstones of liberal democracy - are now at risk. By embracing Russia, the far-right tacitly endorses a world order that marginalizes the vulnerable and criminalizes difference. This alliance does not just undermine Western values; it actively poisons them, making international organisations and treaties useless.
<br><br>
In a number of Western countries, including some European Union member states, certain political figures, such as Viktor Orbán, have been reported, according to a number of independent journalistic investigations and analytical reports, to be involved in corruption schemes and maintain close ties to Russian interests. These politicians have been seen actively undermining strategic decisions within institutions like the EU and NATO. Such actions often appear to betray the very values these bodies were established to protect.
<br><br>
These figures frequently block critical initiatives, especially when these actions contradict Russian interests: from halting Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia’s entry into NATO at crucial moments, to sabotaging military aid and delaying EU membership processes. Their actions are not isolated; they reflect a broader agenda to weaken these alliances from within, aligning with Russian interests over democratic principles.
<br><br>
This manipulation sets a dangerous precedent, eroding unity and compromising the stability and security these institutions are meant to uphold.</p>

            <p><strong>Davy</strong> (b. 25 April 1999, Saint Petersburg, Russia) is a developer, 3D artist, and independent digital content creator. Known for projects in web development, 3D graphics, video game modifications, and creative performances that use game environments as a form of protest. Advocates for human rights, online anonymity, freedom of speech, and LGBT+ rights.</p>
<br>
<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>From childhood, he was interested in electricity and electronics, spending much time with his electrician grandfather, who encouraged experimentation with devices. In 2010, he moved to the settlement of Dubrovka in Leningrad Oblast, where he worked on 3D graphics and video editing at the local youth film studio. At age 13, he began learning programming: first writing scripts in <code>.bat</code> and <code>.vbs</code>, then creating simple HTML websites. By 17, he had mastered the <strong>PHP/MySQL/HTML/JS</strong> stack and started freelancing.</p>
<br>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>At 21, he took a job in Tyumen working on a large commercial legacy PHP project involving payment system integration and handling large datasets. He was responsible for API design, database architecture, and documentation. During this period, he fully left his family and came out publicly. He studied <strong>Vue</strong> and Nim, using Python as a supplementary scripting language while criticising its dominance in AI development.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, he worked on personal projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>2D games and game prototypes</li>
<li>Modifications for Garry's Mod:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2954676697" target="_blank">Alexei Navalny's SHIZO Cell</a></li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2856688403" target="_blank">My Cell in Tyumen Pre-Trial Detention Centre</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3D game <a href="/en/projects/russian-detention-simulator/" target="_blank">Russian Detention Simulator</a> on Unreal Engine 5.6.0</li>
<li>Launching a <a href="https://adultbaby.ru/" target="_blank">Russian-speaking ABDL community</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Civic Position and Emigration</h2>
<p>After the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, he publicly spoke out against Russian war crimes, for which he was sentenced by the Tyumen Regional Court to six months in a colony-settlement. After release, he faced political pressure, searches, and confiscations by the FSB. He left Russia, residing in Armenia and Georgia, and following a worsening political situation in Georgia, obtained a humanitarian visa to France and political asylum. He channels protest through creative performances, believing that games and interactive projects can attract more attention than traditional actions.</p>
<br>
<h2>Skills and Technologies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> PHP, JavaScript, Nim, Python, C++21, Java</li>
<li><strong>Technologies:</strong> MySQL, HTML, Vue, MongoDB, Node, Ionic Capacitor, Apache Cordova</li>
<li><strong>3D Graphics:</strong> strengths – civil engineering and architectural visualisation; more challenging – organic modelling and animation</li>
<li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Unreal Engine 5.6.0, Garry’s Mod (mods)</li>
<li><strong>Other:</strong> creating rules and documentation, community administration, project management</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Public Activity</h2>
<p>Known as a developer of independent projects and an author of game performances with political and social subtext. He considers digital art and game development an effective tool of activism, capable of influencing public consciousness while bypassing traditional forms of opposition.</p>
<br>
<h2>Political Views and Philosophy</h2>
<p>Devi holds secular and post-nationalist views, advocating the unification of humanity into a technocratic society where national borders and state institutions lose significance. He believes that maintaining linguistic, cultural, and political barriers impedes progress.</p>
<br><p>He opposes private ownership of land and real estate, considering the very idea of land ownership unjust to every newborn human. He condemns monopoly on landholding, supports high taxes on excess residential property, and stricter accountability for real estate speculation.</p>
<br><p>He does not identify as a communist or leftist and criticises the intersectional approach in activism. He believes aid should be provided to those whose beliefs do not involve harming or discriminating against those offering help.</p>
<br><p>Devi considers Russia a terrorist state, his political views shaped by personal experiences of state pressure, imprisonment, and emigration. He opposes militarism and authoritarianism, supports LGBT+ rights, freedom of speech, and the right to online anonymity.</p>
<br><p>He focuses on technological progress as the only path to solving humanity's global problems. He believes that pooling efforts and resources to create new technologies can reduce dependence on oil, minimise environmental damage, and efficiently allocate resources instead of resorting to war and conflict.</p>
<br><p>He considers digital projects and technological initiatives (Mozilla Firefox, Tor, uBlock, YggDrasil, Delta Chat, Matrix) key to preserving freedom and independence from corporations seeking to monopolise the internet.</p>
<br>
<h2>Creative Motivation</h2>
<p>Devi uses video games and interactive projects as a tool for political and social activism, believing that new generations no longer respond to standard forms of protest. He compares this to the transition from newspapers to radio, radio to television, and television to the internet: the format of information reception changes, and the future belongs to future generations.</p>
<br><p>He views activism through technology as "smart activism", often incomprehensible to traditional authorities. His projects, incorporating elements of humour and satire, attract wide attention. This approach allows influence over public consciousness while avoiding direct conflict with repressive structures.</p>
<br><p>Experiences of emigration, difficulties in renting accommodation, and pressure from the FSB have formed a practical understanding of resource monopolisation and freedom restriction, reinforcing the conviction that technology must be used to change society and drive global progress.</p>
<br><p>Devi believes humanity has a greater purpose than creating entertainment content and war, and that technological progress is key to solving social, economic, and environmental challenges.</p>
